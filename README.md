# Overview

This project is a simple software application created as part of my journey to strengthen my skills as a software engineer. The purpose of this software is to practice the process of setting up a development environment, writing code, using version control (Git), and sharing code via GitHub â€” all essential practices for modern software development.

The application prints a basic "Hello World" message along with my name and a short, personalized message. While simple, this project is a foundational step in building a personal portfolio and following best practices in software engineering.
